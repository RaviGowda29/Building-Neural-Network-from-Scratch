# Building-Neural-Network-from-Scratch

This is Part 1 of the repository, where we focus on implementing a simple neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy.
Sections Covered in Part 1

    Overview: Introduction to the project, focusing on building a neural network from scratch for multi-class classification.
    Installation: Instructions to set up the project and install necessary dependencies (e.g., NumPy).
    Usage: How to run the code and train the neural network on a spiral dataset.
    Components: Key components of the neural network, including layers, activations (ReLU and Softmax), and the loss function (categorical cross-entropy).
